<!-- HTML5 -->

<!-- 
    When writing HTML5 documents, one of the first new features that you'll notice is the doc type declaration:
        <!DOCTYPE HTML>
 -->
<!-- New Elements in HTML5:
        <article>, <aside>, <audio>, <canvas>, <datalist>, <details>, <embed>, <footer>, <header>, <nav>, <output>, <progress>, <section>, <video>, and even more! -->

<!-- 
        The character encoding (charset) declaration is also simplified:
        <meta charset="UTF-8">
  -->

<!-- 
        *Content Models*:

        Metadata: Content that sets up the presentation or behavior of the rest of the content. These elements are found in the head of the document.
        Elements: <base>, <link>, <meta>, <noscript>, <script>, <style>, <title>

        Embedded: Content that imports other resources into the document.
        Elements: <audio>, <video>, <canvas>, <iframe>, <img>, <math>, <object>, <svg>

        Interactive: Content specifically intended for user interaction.
        Elements: <a>, <audio>, <video>, <button>, <details>, <embed>, <iframe>, <img>, <input>, <label>, <object>, <select>, <textarea>

        Heading: Defines a section header.
        Elements: <h1>, <h2>, <h3>, <h4>, <h5>, <h6>, <hgroup>

        Phrasing: This model has a number of inline level elements in common with HTML4.
        Elements: <img>, <span>, <strong>, <label>, <br />, <small>, <sub>, and more.
 -->

 <!-- 
        In HTML5, a simple <header> tag is used.
        The <header> element is appropriate for use inside the body tag.
            <!DOCTYPE html>
            <html>
                <head></head>
                <body>
                    <header>
                        <h1>Most important heading</h1>
                        <h3>Less important heading</h3>
                    </header>
                </body>
            </html>
  -->

  <!-- 
      The <nav> Element:
            This tag represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to certain sections within the page. This would be a section with navigation links.
            Here is an example of a major block of navigation links:
                <nav>
                    <ul>
                        <li><a href="#">Home</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#">Services</a></li>
                        <li><a href="#">About us</a></li>
                    </ul>
                </nav>
   -->

   <!-- 
       Article is a self-contained, independent piece of content that can be used and distributed separately from the rest of the page or site.
       This could be a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent piece of content.
       Ex:
            <article>
                <h1>The article title</h1> 
                <p>Contents of the article element </p>
            </article>
    -->

    <!-- 
        <section> is a logical container of the page or article.
        Sections can be used to divide up content within an article.
        For example, a homepage could have a section for introducing the company, another for news items, and still another for contact information.
        Each <section> should be identified, typically by including a heading (h1-h6 element) as a child of the <section> element.
            Ex:
                <article>
                    <h1>Welcome</h1>
                    <section>
                        <h1>Heading</h1>
                        <p>content or image</p>
                    </section>
                </article>
     -->

     <!-- 
         <aside> is secondary or tangential content which could be considered separate from but indirectly related to the main content.
        This type of content is often represented in sidebars.
        When an <aside> tag is used within an <article> tag, the content of the <aside> should be specifically related to that article.
            EX:
                <article>
                    <h1> Gifts for everyone</h1>
                    <p>This website will be the best place for choosing gifts</p>
                    <aside>
                        <p>Gifts will be delivered to you within 24 hours</p>
                    </aside>
                </article>

          Audio on the Web:
            There are two different ways to specify the audio source file's URL. The first uses the source attribute:
                1)      <audio src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/audio.mp3" controls>
                            Audio element not supported by your browser
                        </audio>
            
                2)      <audio controls>
                            <source src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/audio.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
                            <source src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/audio.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
                        </audio> 


            Attributes of <audio>:
                controls: Specifies that audio controls should be displayed (such as a play/pause button, etc.) 
                autoplay: When this attribute is defined, audio starts playing as soon as it is ready, without asking for the visitor's permission.
                loop: This attribute is used to have the audio replay every time it is finished.
       -->

<!-- 
    Videos in HTML:
        The video element is similar to the audio element.
        You can specify the video source URL using an attribute in a video element, or using source elements inside the video element:
        Ex:
                <video controls>
                    <source src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    <source src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
                    Video is not supported by your browser
                </video>

    Attributes of <video>:
        Another aspect shared by both the audio and the video elements is that each has controls, autoplay and loop attributes.
        In this example, the video will replay after it finishes playing:
                <video controls autoplay loop>
                    <source src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/video.mp4" type="video/mp4">
                    <source src="http://www.sololearn.com/uploads/video.ogg" type="video/ogg">
                    Video is not supported by your browser
                </video>

<!-- 
    Progress Bar:
        The <progress> element provides the ability to create progress bars on the web.
        The progress element can be used within headings, paragraphs, or anywhere else in the body.

    Progress Element Attributes:
        Value: Specifies how much of the task has been completed.
        Max: Specifies how much work the task requires in total.

     Types of Web Storage Objects
        There are two types of web storage objects:
            - sessionStorage()
            - localStorage()

    Local vs. Session
        - Session Storage is destroyed once the user closes the browser
        - Local Storage stores data with no expiration date

    The syntax for web storage for both local and session storage is very simple and similar.
        The data is stored as key/value pairs.

    Storing a Value: localStorage.setItem("key1", "value1");
    Getting a Value: alert(localStorage.getItem("key1")); 
    Removing a Value: localStorage.removeItem("key1");
    Removing All Values: localStorage.clear();

  <!-- 
      What is the Geolocation API?
        In HTML5, the Geolocation API is used to obtain the user's geographical location.
        Since this can compromise user privacy, the option is not available unless the user approves it.

        The Geolocation API’s main method is getCurrentPosition, which retrieves the current geographic location of the user's device.
            EX: navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition();
            Parameters:
                showLocation (mandatory): Defines the callback method that retrieves location information.
                ErrorHandler(optional): Defines the callback method that is invoked when an error occurs in processing the asynchronous call.
                Options (optional): Defines a set of options for retrieving the location information.
   -->

   <!-- 
       Presenting Data
        User location can be presented in two ways: Geodetic and Civic.
            1. The geodetic way to describe position refers directly to latitude and longitude.
            2. The civic representation of location data is presented in a format that is more easily read and understood by the average person.

    <!-- 
        Making Elements Draggable
            The drag and drop feature lets you "grab" an object and drag it to a different location.
            To make an element draggable, just set the draggable attribute to true:
                <img draggable="true" />
     -->

         Drawing Shapes
            SVG stands for Scalable Vector Graphics, and is used to draw shapes with HTML-style markup.
            It offers several methods for drawing paths, boxes, circles, text, and graphic images.

        Shape Animations
            SVG animations can be created using the <animate> element.
                attributeName: Specifies which attribute will be affected by the animation
                from: Specifies the starting value of the attribute
                to: Specifies the ending value of the attribute
                dur: Specifies how long the animation runs (duration)
                fill: Specifies whether or not the attribute's value should return to its initial value when the animation is finished (Values: "remove" resets the value; "freeze" keeps the “to value”)
                repeatCount: Specifies the repeat count of the animation
        
        Paths
            The <path> element is used to define a path.
                The following commands are available for path data:
                M: moveto
                L: lineto
                H: horizontal lineto
                V: vertical lineto
                C: curveto
                S: smooth curveto
                Q: quadratic Bézier curve
                T: smooth quadratic Bézier curveto
                A: elliptical Arc
                Z: closepath

        The <canvas> Element
            The HTML canvas is used to draw graphics that include everything from simple lines to complex graphic objects.
                The <canvas> element is defined by:
                <canvas id="canvas1" width="200" height="100">
                </canvas>

            The <canvas> element must have an id attribute so it can be referred to by JavaScript:
            <html>
            <head></head>
            <body>
                <canvas id="canvas1" 
            width="400" height="300"></canvas> 

            <script>
                var can = document.getElementById("canvas1"); 
                var ctx = can.getContext("2d");
            </script>

            </body>
            </html>
            HTML
            getContext() returns a drawing context on the canvas.

        Drawing Shapes
            The fillRect(x, y, w, h) method draws a "filled" rectangle, in which w indicates width and h indicates height.
            The default fill color is black.
                The fillStyle property is used to set a color, gradient, or pattern to fill the drawing.
                Using this property allows you to draw a green-filled rectangle.
        
            The canvas supports various other methods for drawing:

            Draw a Line
            moveTo(x,y): Defines the starting point of the line.
            lineTo(x,y): Defines the ending point of the line.

            Draw a Circle
            beginPath(): Starts the drawing.
            arc(x,y,r,start,stop): Sets the parameters of the circle.
            stroke(): Ends the drawing.

            Gradients
            createLinearGradient(x,y,x1,y1): Creates a linear gradient.
            createRadialGradient(x,y,r,x1,y1,r1): Creates a radial/circular gradient.

            Drawing Text on the Canvas
            Font: Defines the font properties for the text.
            fillText(text,x,y): Draws "filled" text on the canvas.
            strokeText(text,x,y): Draws text on the canvas (no fill).
    

    Canvas vs. SVG
        Canvas
        - Elements are drawn programmatically
        - Drawing is done with pixels
        - Animations are not built in
        - High performance for pixels-based drawing operations
        - Resolution dependent
        - No support for event handlers
        - You can save the resulting image as .png or .jpg
        - Well suited for graphic-intensive games

        SVG
        - Elements are part of the page's DOM (Document object model)
        - Drawing is done with vectors
        - Effects, such as animations are built in
        - Based on standard XML syntax, which provides better accessibility
        - Resolution independent
        - Support for event handlers
        - Not suited for game applications
        - Best suited for applications with large rendering areas (for example, Google Maps)

    HTML5 Forms
        HTML5 brings many features and improvements to web form creation.
        There are new attributes and input types that were introduced to help create better experiences for web users.
        HTML5 has introduced a new attribute called placeholder. On <input> and <textarea> elements, this attribute provides a hint to the user of what information can be entered into the field.

    HTML5 added several new input types:
    - color
    - date
    - datetime
    - datetime-local
    - email
    - month
    - number
    - range
    - search
    - tel
    - time
    - url
    - week

    New input attributes in HTML5:
    - autofocus
    - form
    - formaction
    - formenctype
    - formmethod
    - formnovalidate
    - formtarget
    - height and width
    - list
    - min and max
    - multiple
    - pattern (regexp)
    - placeholder
    - required
    - step
